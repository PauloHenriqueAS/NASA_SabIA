# Climatic Forecasting Project for Uberl칙ndia (MG)

This repository contains notebooks and scripts developed for forecasting climatic variables for the city of Uberl칙ndia, Minas Gerais, using Machine Learning models. The project is divided into stages of model study and validation, and subsequently, productization to generate future databases for application use.

## 1. Solution Study: Model Construction and Evaluation with Historical Data

In this initial phase, the focus was on building and evaluating different modeling approaches to predict climatic variables. The `train_and_forecast_diario.ipynb` and `train_and_forecast_longo_prazo.ipynb` notebooks detail this process.

### Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

Both models (short and long term) share a robust data preparation and feature engineering phase:

- **Data Acquisition**: Collection of historical climatic data from NASA POWER (MultiLocation) and climatic indices such as SOI (Southern Oscillation Index) and ONI (Oceanic Ni침o Index).
- **Temporal Lags**: Creation of lagged variables for climatic variables and SOI/ONI indices, allowing the model to capture temporal dependencies.
- **Seasonality**: Extraction of time attributes such as month, day of year, day of week, week of year, and their sinusoidal and cosinusoidal representations to model annual and weekly seasonal patterns.
- **Location Filtering**: The dataset is filtered to include only data from Uberl칙ndia, but the methodology can be replicated for other cities.

## 2. Productization and Future Database Generation

The `gerar_base_uberlandia.ipynb` notebook represents the "productization" phase. It uses the model trained with the largest amount of historical data available to generate future forecasts that will be consumed by an application (APP).

- **Comprehensive Training**: Models are trained with data up to the most recent available date (e.g., October 2, 2025), ensuring that the forecast is based on the most up-to-date knowledge.
- **Recurrent Forecasting**: For future database generation, forecasting is done in a recurrent/recursive manner. The forecast for one day is used as input for the next day's forecast, allowing a series of forecasts to be generated for the coming months (e.g., six months).
- **Output for the APP**: The generated forecasts are saved in CSV files in the `forecast/` folder for easy integration into external applications.

## 3. Short-Term Modeling (Daily Forecast)

The `train_and_forecast_diario.ipynb` notebook explores the forecasting of climatic variables with a focus on **short-term**, typically predicting conditions for the next day.

- **Objective**: Simulate a real operational scenario of daily forecasting.
- **Methodology**: Uses XGBoost models trained for each target variable (maximum, minimum, and average temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed). The dataset is divided into training (2020-2024) and validation (January-June 2025) sets.
- **Evaluation**: Performance is assessed using metrics such as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### Daily Model Results

Below are examples of graphs generated by `train_and_forecast_diario.ipynb` that compare actual values with forecasts for climatic variables:

## 4. Long-Term Modeling

The `train_and_forecast_longo_prazo.ipynb` and `gerar_base_uberlandia.ipynb` notebooks are dedicated to **long-term** forecasting, projecting climatic conditions for the coming months.

- **Objective**: Predict conditions for an extended period (e.g., six months ahead).
- **Methodology**: Similar to the short-term model, it uses XGBoost with advanced feature engineering. The crucial difference is the forecasting horizon and the recurrent strategy. The model is trained up to a point in time (e.g., end of 2024) and then generates forecasts for the subsequent period (e.g., first six months of 2025) recursively, where each forecast is fed back as input for the next one.
- **Application**: These forecasts form the basis for creating a future database that feeds the APP, allowing for early visualization of climatic conditions.
